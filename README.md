Activity 2 repo for 3900
In this activity we were to build a simple website with an appropriate topic.  I chose to make simple three page website pertaining to my hobbies, education, family, and 
contact information.  It is comprised of three html documents, and one CSS style sheet.  Four pictures are included in the build.
