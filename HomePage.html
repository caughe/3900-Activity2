            About Me
        </h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Omaha, NE but grew up in Iowa.  I was raised on a farm in southwest Iowa.  I have one sibling and her name is Amanda.  She has three boys of her own.  My wife and I have been married three years now, and we were married here in Omaha at the Henry Doorly Zoo.  My wife's name is Jena and she is the most amazing person I know. We have two dogs named Barkley, and Roxy.  They are like our kids, they misbehave and cause minor mischief here and there.  We also like to travel and below is a picture from one of our trips.

            <p>
                I am currently a senior here at UNO, and my major is in MIS.  I graduated from high school in 2003.  Yes, I am older than probably the majority of the students in my class.  I will be graduating with my Bachelors of Science in MIS in May of 2021.

            Hobbies
        </h2> 
            <p>
                For fun I like to excercise and workout most days of the week, it for sure helps me come down from a long day at work or working on class projects etc.  I also love to spend time with my wife, and our two dogs as much as I can right now.  I also like to play games on my PC when time allows.
